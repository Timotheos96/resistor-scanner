# resistor_identifier

A new Flutter project that will identify the value of a resistor by scanning it.

## Resistor Scanner

The main idea is to use color segmentation in order to seperate the color bands on the resistor.
Then identify the location of each color so the resistor value can be calculated correctly. 


This table is being used as a reference point in order to calculate the resistor value:
